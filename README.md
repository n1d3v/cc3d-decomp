# CrazyCattle3D decompilation
This is a decompilation of the game CrazyCattle3D. I made this so I can modify the game to my heart's content.

This was decompiled using [gdsdecomp](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp) and you need to use Godot version 4.4.1 to modify this game.

> Note: I don't own this game, all the credits go to Anna (4nn4t4t on itch.io). You can find the original game link on itch.io: https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d
